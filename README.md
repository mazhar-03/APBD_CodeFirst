I used Docker. Here's my app settings configuration:

In my configuration file there is a "ConnectionString" which holds the value for the "DefaultConnection"

In that connection I have ->

Server: Specify the server address with port.  For example: ************,&&&&

Database: Specify name of the database.

User Id: Specify the the user ID for authentication.

Password: Specifies the password for the user ID, again for authanticate the connection

TrustServerCertificate: Boolean value, for ignoring SSL certificate validation
